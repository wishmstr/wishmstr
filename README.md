## Hello there!  I'm Jason Franklin and this is a collection of my works from over the years.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating more Terraform modules that can be used to piece together an infrastructure quick and painlessly.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Docker, Ansible, and Terraform.  I'm also learning more about Amazon Web Services
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on expanding on my Lackey-Docker project to take it to the next level.
- ðŸ’¬ I have a love of old card games and documenting them before the knowledge is lost to time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have worked on reviving multiple dead card games.  I run multiple dedicated Discord servers for the games.  I also run in-person events at GenCon (a 4 day gaming convention held in Indianapolis, IN) for at least one of my games, looking to possibly run events for a second.
